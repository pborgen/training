# The App Runner service egresses ALL traffic through the VPC connector
# (egress_type = "VPC", so it can reach private RDS). The default-VPC subnets
# have no NAT gateway, so the instance has no route to the public internet.

# The RAG coach calls Bedrock at runtime, so without a path to Bedrock it would
# time out. Rather than add a NAT gateway (and expose the service to the whole
# internet), we add a PrivateLink interface endpoint for the Bedrock runtime API.

# via its managed infrastructure, not through the VPC connector.
